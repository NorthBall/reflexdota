Download the ZIP of this repository and unzip it to any folder to begin the installation.

Automatic Installation
----------------------
Double click on "Reflex Install.bat".  The script will find the dota directory and copy over the necessary files


Manual Installation
----------------
Drop the "dota" directory on top of your base dota directory, which is usually located at
	C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta

This will copy in the "reflex" addon to the "dota\addons\reflex" path and the "reflex.cfg" file to "dota\cfg".


Running the Game
-----------------
To start the game mode, make sure Dota isn't running and double click the "Play Reflex" link.  
You will be prompted to accept a string of launch commands for dota, and hitting OK will start DOTA up with the ability to run "reflex".
You will be given access to the console in dota, and can execute "connect <IP>:<PORT>" to connect to a dedicated server running reflex.

The Game----
------------
-Reflex games are round-based and played until a team has 10 wins
-Each round has a pre-round time where each player can buy/upgrade abilities and items from the shop
-Once a round starts, you can no longer buy or upgrade items/abilities until the round is over when you will get your gold and ability points back
-All heroes are identical initially, the only difference is the cosmetic model.
-All heroes use a quickly charging energy system instead of a slowly recharging mana system
-All heroes start with two items, the Reflex Dash and Simple Shooter items.
-Reflex Dash item is just like Force Boots from the New Bloom event, except it has automatically recharging charges and is upgradeable
-Almost all items are upgradeable and many use a recharging charge system
-All offensive abilities are directional, point target, or PBAoE, so aiming is important as is dodging
-A round ends when time runs out or one team loses all of its players
-The last player alive for a team gains the Last Man Standing buff, allowing them to do up to double damage while they still can
-Round winners get more gold, and losers get more levels for the next round


Item Examples
------------------
-Shotgun: Fire up to 2 shots at short range for big damage, assuming you can catch your target
-Long Shot: Pepper the enemies with long range waves doing low but safe damage
-Sunstrike Barrage: Unleash multiple sunstrikes anywhere on the map in rapid succession until out of charges
-Meteor Cannon: Charge up a massive meteor that flies across the map in speed proportional to the charge time.  Explodes on impact
-Crippler: Covers an nearby enemy with goop, preventing them from dashing for the duration
-Mega Flare: Call down a delayed massive magical strike that decimates all enemies caught
And many more...

Ability Examples
------------------
-Phase Shift: Dodge in place!
-Energy Drain: Create a draining field that significantly reduces enemy energy regeneration if caught in the cloud
-Borrowed Time: No automatic activation, and short duration, but extremely powerful for turning a devestating attack into a massive boon
-Kinetic Field: Trap an enemy in place and prevent them from dashing around
-Vengeance: When an ally dies, gain a massive reduction in received damage for a short time.  Go HAM!
-Scaredy Cat: When an ally dies, gain a movement speed boost and a healing salve effect.  Run Away!
And many more...

.02.00

-Rebalanced Kinetic Field.  It now lasts longer at level 3 and 4, has 200 more cast range at all levels, and can be cast on the point target without turning (helpful for escaping/baiting)

-Reduced the early level damage of power shot
