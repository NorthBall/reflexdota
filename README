Automatic Installation
----------------------
Double click on "Reflex Install.bat".  The script will find the dota directory and copy over the necessary files


Manual Installation
----------------
Drop the "dota" directory on top of your base dota directory, which is usually located at
	C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta

This will copy in the "reflex" addon to the "dota\addons\reflex" path and the "reflex.cfg" file to "dota\cfg".


Running the Game
-----------------
To start the game mode, make sure Dota isn't running and double click the "Play Reflex" link.  
You will be prompted to accept a string of launch commands for dota, and hitting OK will start DOTA up with the ability to run "reflex".

The Game----
------------
-Reflex games are round-based and played until a team has 10 wins
-Each round has a pre-round time where each player can buy/upgrade abilities and items from the shop
-Once a round starts, you can no longer buy or upgrade items/abilities until the round is over when you will get your gold and ability points back
-All heroes are identical initially, the only difference is the cosmetic model.
-All heroes use a quickly charging energy system instead of a slowly recharging mana system
-All heroes start with two items, the Reflex Dash and Simple Shooter items.
-Reflex Dash item is just like Force Boots from the New Bloom event, except it has automatically recharging charges and is upgradeable
-Almost all items are upgradeable and many use a recharging charge system
-All offensive abilities are directional, point target, or PBAoE, so aiming is important as is dodging
-A round ends when time runs out or one team loses all of its players
-The last player alive for a team gains the Last Man Standing buff, allowing them to do up to double damage while they still can
-Round winners get more gold, and losers get more levels for the next round


Item Examples
------------------
-Shotgun: Fire up to 2 shots at short range for big damage, assuming you can catch your target
-Long Shot: Pepper the enemies with long range waves doing low but safe damage
-Sunstrike Barrage: Unleash multiple sunstrikes anywhere on the map in rapid succession until out of charges
-Meteor Cannon: Charge up a massive meteor that flies across the map in speed proportional to the charge time.  Explodes on impact
