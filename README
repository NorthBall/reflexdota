Automatic Installation
----------------------
Double click on "Reflex Install.bat".  The script will find the dota directory and copy over the necessary files


Manual Installation
----------------
Drop the "dota" directory on top of your base dota directory, which is usually located at
	C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta

This will copy in the "reflex" addon to the "dota\addons\reflex" path and the "reflex.cfg" file to "dota\cfg".


Running the Game
-----------------
To start the game mode, make sure Dota isn't running and double click the "Play Reflex" link.  
You will be prompted to accept a string of launch commands for dota, and hitting OK will start DOTA up with the ability to run "reflex".
