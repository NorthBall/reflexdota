To Install
----------------
Drop the "dota" directory on top of your base dota directory, which is usually located at
	C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta

This will copy in the "reflex" addon to the "dota\addons\reflex" path and the "reflex.cfg" file to "dota\cfg".
To start the game mode, you can execute the "Dota Reflex Game Mode".  
You will be prompted to accept a string of launch commands for dota, and hitting OK will start DOTA up with the ability to run "reflex".

Once the game loads, you will see a console prompt, simply type
	exec reflex.cfg

and the game will load and connect to my server.
